# VQGAN+CLIP for Azure Machine Learning

This is a port of tk's excellent [regulized notebook](tk) that runs on the Azure Machine Learning cloud. It's intended to show the shortest path between running a non-trivial ML model locally and getting it running in the Azure cloud on more powerful GPU-optimized machines. For more, see my blog post [tk](tk).
